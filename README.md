##Release Notes:

###1.1.6
- Fixed issue where developers would get a 403 when sending logs/analytics to the Mobile Analytics service.

###1.1.5:
- Added the ability to record network transactions by using `Analytics.DeviceEvent.NETWORK` as one of the device events when calling `Analytics.initialize()`.

###1.1.4:
- Fixed issue regarding an exception log that was being shown when reading the SDK version number.

###1.1.3:
- Fixed NullPointerException when calling `Analytics.send()` or `Logger.send()` without a response listener.

###1.1.2:
- Fixed problem with `Analytics.init()` where if you set `hasUserContext` to `false`, it would not properly initialize.

###1.1.1:
- Changed Javadoc and corrected small logic error

###1.1.0:
- Added new initializer in order to avoid double counting anonymous users and named users as the same. Deprecated `BMSAnalytics.clearUserIdentity()`, will be removed in 2.x.

###1.0.5:
- Android Nougat officially supported; changed target SDK version to Android 24.

###1.0.3:
- Fixed error with App Sessions not being properly counted.

Known limitation - currently v2.x of Android SDK does not submit monitoring data. This is a work in progress and will be delivered in following months. If youâ€™d like to continue receiving monitoring data in the service dashboard you can continue using the v1.x SDK.
